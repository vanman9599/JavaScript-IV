// CODE here for your Lambda Classes
// * First we need a Person class. This will be our `base-class`
// * Person receives `name` `age` `location` `gender` all as props
// * Person receives `speak` as a method.
// * This method logs out a phrase `Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock` where `name`
//  and `location` are the object's own props
class Person{
    constructor(attr){
        this.name = attr.name;
        this.age = attr.age;
        this.location = attr.location;
        this.gender = attr.gender;
    }

    speak(){
        return `Hello my name is ${this.name}, I am from ${this.location}`;
    }
}
